This is a repository for my Multi-Modal Interfaces course for a project worked in collaboration with Hidai!

## prototype video log
To keep track of the project progress I'll just have a listing of videos that show clips from the very beginning when I got the SDK to finally work all the way to a (hopeful) completion!
1. The SDK works! I have a skeleton! It doesn't overlay on top of me unfortunately, but yay for progress - [video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/28300mt40cquufe/IMG_8375.MOV?dl=0){:target="_blank"}
2. Skeleton properly mapping to video frame of me walking/dancing awkwardly - [video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaolrhxlo2m21ip/IMG_8376.MOV?dl=0){:target="_blank"}
3. Showing a shirt overlayed with me (almost) accurately - [video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxbhurxkorq85zh/MainWindow%202020-05-03%2000-24-59.mp4?dl=0){:target="_blank"}
